MÃ©tEX was created by Richard Whittaker originally for my University final-year project in 2004. It's gone through several revisions and updates, culminating in this, the 2020 version.

My personal website is [Sblorgh.org](https://www.sblorgh.org), you can check my [Github profile](https://github.com/PkerUNO), or you can send me an email at [richard@metex.app](mailto:richard@metex.app).
