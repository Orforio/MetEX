# MétEX - The Paris Métro Experience

MétEX is a virtual tour of the Paris Métro, which I originally developed in Flash and ASP.net for my university final-year project.

This is the latest iteration of the site, built statically in Angular with Scully, retrieving content from a [Strapi CMS](https://github.com/PkerUNO/MetEX-CMS). I hope to continue developing new features and update the content soon. Please feel free to report bugs or suggest new features.

[You can visit MétEX at metex.app](http://www.metex.app/).

The old Flash, PHP and Rails versions has been discontinued and are no longer live.

Have fun exploring the Paris Métro!
